# Valid Anagram

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

## Examples

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `s = "racecar"`, `t = "carrace"`
- **Output:** `true`

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `s = "jar"`, `t = "jam"`
- **Output:** `false`

## Constraints

- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Sorting
1. Sort both strings
2. Compare if they are equal

### Approach 2: Character Frequency
1. Count frequency of each character in both strings
2. Compare the frequency maps

### Approach 3: Hash Map
1. Use a hash map to track character counts
2. Increment for string `s`, decrement for string `t`
3. Check if all counts
